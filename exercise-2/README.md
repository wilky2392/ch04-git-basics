# Exercise 2

Learn the basics of git workflow:

1. **Fork** the repo onto your own github account  
(maybe you already did it)

2. clone it to your laptop  
`git clone ...`

3. Download an image from the web and place it into the repo folder
   into _exercise-2_ subfolder.
   
4. Add this file to _git_.  See [Adding
   Files](file:///home/otoomet/tyyq/teaching/info201/book/localbook/build/git-basics.html#adding-files). 
   
5. Write a paragraph of text where you explaine what the picture is
   about.  Feel free to add more.

4. commit your changes:  
`git commit -am "<explain what did you do>"`

5. send your edits back to GitHub
`git push`

6. check the repo on your github account.  Did it work?
