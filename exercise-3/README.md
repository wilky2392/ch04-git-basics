# Exercise 3

This exercise introduces git branches.  In git you can split your
development into different branches, and change some of these, and
merge the changes back to the others.

1. This exercise comes in two branches: a) master -- this version, and
   b) complete -- a version with solutions.
   
   list all the versions using _git_ and it's command line options.

2. Modify this readme file by writing the git commands to find out
   branches (both local and remote) of the current repo!
